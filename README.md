# Lezer Debug

## Try it live: [lezer.andrewbast.in](https://lezer.andrewbast.in)

<br />

A quick utility web app to build and test Lezer Grammars.

I built this to help me build and improve the Lezer grammar for [GraphQL used in Hoppscotch](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch/tree/main/packages/codemirror-lang-graphql) (which would also love your contributions!).
